# Coastal Trophic State Index Model (cTSI)

cTSI (coastal trophic state index) contains data and code used in development and application of a Bayesian Proportional Odds Logistic Regression model to classify sites according to water quality variables related to trophic state.

## Overview

The code includes several R markdown files and an associated file containing R functions. The main body of code *coastal_TSI_ts.Rmd* loads the function file located in the functions folder.  Raw data is included as .csv files in the raw directory and various data sets created as intermediate products are in the data folder.  Variable definitions are included in a [data dictionary](https://github.com/USEPA/-cTSI/blob/main/data_dictionary.md)
