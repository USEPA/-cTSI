cTSI (coastal trophic state index) contains data and code used in development and application of a Bayesian Proportional Odds Logistic Regression model to classify sites according to water quality variables related to trophic state.

## Installation

The code includes several R markdown files and an associated file containing R functions.  It is not an R package. The main body of code coastal_TSI_ts.Rmd loads the function file.

## Citation

The code has been used to generate the analysis reported in
